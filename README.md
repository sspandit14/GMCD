Grandmaster Chair Dweller (bot) for the official DataSC discord server! (WIP)

To Dos:
- basic function transfer from old gmcd ✅
  - role removal ✅ 
  - DataSC server adaptation ✅
- genericize the code ✅
  - (kind of... slash commands make this somewhat true but a lot of values are still hard coded, there is probably a way to do that better so half done for now...)
- add google calendar integration (e.g. add to calander prompt or command for events)
- direct mailing list registration?
  - not sure if from a user's perspective it's easier to do "click link, enter email, boom" vs "slash command, enter email, boom"...
