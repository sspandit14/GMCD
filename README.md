Grandmaster Chair Dweller (bot) for the official DataSC discord server! (WIP)

To Dos:
- basic function transfer from old gmcd ✅
  - role removal ✅ 
  - DataSC server adaptation ✅
- genericize the code ✅
  - (kind of... slash commands make this somewhat true but a lot of values are still hard coded, there is probably a way to do that better so half done for now...)
- Bot code documentation?
- Possible Slash Command List
  - /help command that would outline not only the commands available and their specifics but also an overview of the interface perhaps? (the slash command descriptions seem good enough tho so not sure...) ✅
  - schedule command that displays an overview of upcoming events (ideally everything -- meetings, events, socials, etc.)
  - add google calendar integration (e.g. add to calander prompt or command for events)
  - birthday bot features!
  - direct mailing list registration?
    - not sure if from a user's perspective it's easier to do "click link, enter email, boom" vs "slash command, enter email, boom"...

code based on tutorials by the following channels and resources:
